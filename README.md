# Expensable Transactions

## Introduction

Render, filter and sort list items is one of the most common features to implement as a frontend developer. You can leverage the power of React Hooks to make the job easy and resilient.

This week project consist on implementing the Transactions component for the Expensable application.

### Backend API: https://github.com/codeableorg/expensable-api

## Requirements

The transaction component should:

Show all the transactions (expenses and income) for the selected month group by date in descending order.
Each group should show the sum of all the transactions of the day.
Expenses should be rendered in color red and income in green.
A click on the filter icon should open the filters box.
Changes on the filters inputs should update the transaction list on real time.
Only days with at least one transaction should be printed.
Implement at least 2 unit test and 1 E2E test.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
